# Notes
An Android app to take notes in a organized way


## App overview

This app will have:
- A main screen compound of a list of several **notebooks**. They will separate and categorize the different **notes** of the user.
- There will be also a floating button which leads to a screen designed to add a new notebook. It ask for a **title** and a **description**.
- Once inside a notebook, we will see the different notes of the user. They will be able to be displayed as a grid or a list. By default they will be sorted by order of creation, but it will be possible to sort them in lexicographical order.
- Here there will be a floating button too used to create new notes. Notes have a **title**, the **note itself** and it will be possible to attach **images** or **audio files** to them.

## About this project
The idea is to implement a simple app in order to learn about some core Android development concepts. 

Goals:
- Fulfil the requirements described in *App overview*.
- Take into account efficiency when using resources.
- Write readable and idiomatic code.
